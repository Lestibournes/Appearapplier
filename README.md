# Nitrogen-Applier
Applies the Nitrogen background file to system settings

Nitrogen doesn't apply it's background setting to the system, so the display manager isn't aware of what the user's background is.
Also, if there are other desktop environments, nitrogen won't change their wallpaper.

This script will modify the GNOME and display manager backgrounds for the current user to follow the Nitrogen background image.

Run in the background:
nitroplier -d

Run once:
nitroplier
